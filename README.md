# CWI Test | Jo√£o A. P. Sieben.

This Landing page was developed as a test only. It uses:
 * [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/), as package manager, and
 * [Angular](https://angular.io/), to fetch data and mount the HTML elements dynamically.

To run the application, simply access the root folder in your browser. The page is mounted with the information from a remote endpoint, and should be listing a few movies, in a catalog format.

There's a search field, that automatically filters the movie list, based on the title and description of each. Also, by clicking on "See more" link, a modal should fade in with information.

This is very basic, once it was made only with a test purpose. Thanks for the attention!
